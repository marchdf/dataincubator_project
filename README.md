Description 
=========== 
The objective of this project is to determine which rental properties need implementation of energy efficiency measures. The target audience for this project is a landlord who has many properties and tenants. Tenant and year-to-year weather variations over the years affect the energy use of each building. To minimize costs, the landlord must be able to identify which buildings are inefficient while controlling for tenant and weather variations. Upon identification, the landlord can allocate resources efficiently to target the most inefficient buildings.

In addition, the landlord can identify whether new tenants are using abnormally more energy than previous tenants. Once identified, the landlord could employ behavioral strategies to encourage tenants to become more energy efficient.

Limitations
===========
Obtaining utility bills for individual rental properties is difficult so I have restricted the analysis to my own property in Ann Arbor, MI. The dataset is therefore small.

Sources
=======
The utility rates are taken from DTE's website and utility bills are my own. Weather data is scrapped from WeatherUnderground with the Python script.
